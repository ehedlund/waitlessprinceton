			<h2>What is waitLess?</h2>
			<p>
				A common problem among Princeton students is time. As the world becomes a faster, busier, and more hectic place, time becomes our most precious resource. We have classes, extracurricular activities, office hours, group project meetups, study breaks, advisory meetings, and obligatory naps, and often, we try to squeeze as much as we can in the few slots of free time we have on our schedules. The worst feeling is to have a mere ten minutes to grab some lunch and spend eight of those minutes waiting in line for the salad bar. In other instances, we think we have time for a quick workout between classes, and that workout is cut short due to the long line to use the treadmills. These situations have happened to all of us, so instead of sprinting into the dining hall and rushing your way to the front of the queue with the aggression of a linebacker, wouldn’t it be nice to know how busy these places are beforehand? The busiest and most frequently used hubs on Princeton’s campus are the dining halls, the libraries, and Dillon gym. Our goal is to track how much traffic flows through each of these places at any given time and to give Princeton students a gauge of how to maximize their free time. We aim to have a working website that students can log into using their netid that displays the daily traffic and historical traffic of the dining halls, libraries, and Dillon gym by the hour all in a single snapshot.
