<P> Time is a Princeton student's most precious resource. We have classes, practices, rehearsals, office hours, 
 group project meetups, study breaks, advising appointments, and obligatory naps. Often, we try to squeeze as much as we 
 can into the few moments of free time we have in our schedules. The worst feeling is having a mere ten minutes to grab 
 some lunch and spending eight of those minutes waiting in line for the salad bar, or thinking we have time for a quick 
 workout between classes only to find out that there are no treadmills available. We've all been caught in these situations, 
 so wouldn’t it be nice to know how busy these spots are before we show up? The busiest spaces on Princeton’s campus are 
 the dining halls, libraries, and gym. waitLess monitors the traffic in these spaces, giving Princeton students the ability 
 to maximize their free time.<br>
